Q 1) Assume a Markov-1 process with covariance matrix R of size 8 × 8 and ρ = 0.91. Compute the 
Energy Packing Efficiency and De-correlation Efficiency of the Walsh-Hadamard Transform and Discrete 
Cosine Transform for the above process. What is your observation about the eigenvectors of R in 
relation to the DCT basis?


Q.2) Find 𝛃𝟐𝑹−𝟏, where 𝛃𝟐 =𝟏−𝛒𝟐𝟏+𝛒𝟐 Does 𝛃𝟐𝑹−𝟏 have a tridiagonal structure? Is it close to the tridiagonal matrix Q? α = 𝛒𝟏𝟏+𝛒𝟐Try diagonalizing 𝛃𝟐𝑹−𝟏, and Q using the DCT matrix. What is your observation?


Q.3) Compute SVD for the given 8 × 8 image g (provided in imageFile.mat) using the following steps: 
a) Perform eigen-value decomposition of 𝒈𝑻𝒈 and 𝒈𝒈𝑻.
b) Find the singular value matrix Σ. 
c) Reconstruct the image using Σ and the eigen-vector matrices.
